	 pg. 1198-1199: Discussion of evaluated data
	 Recommended data (in the form of k_inf) is assumed to be equal to the rate expression
		for CO+C2H5-->H3C-CH2-C=O.  Authors note the rxn is in the fall-off region
		under all conditions.
		Fall-off corrections and collision efficiencies are also available
		(although we do not store them in RMG_database).
