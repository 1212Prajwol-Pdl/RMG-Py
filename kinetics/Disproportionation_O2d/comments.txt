	Literature review: i-C3H7 + O2 = HO2 + C3H6
	pg. 931-932: Discussion on evaluated data
	Entry 42,3 (a): Author appears to be skeptical of the only experimentally reported
		value.  Author notes that more recent work on C2H5+O2 suggested that the
		addition and disproportionation rxns may be coupled through a common intermediate.
		For the time being, the author decided to recommend the only experimentally
		reported rate coefficient, only for temperatures above 700K, as they note the
		addition rxn should be the predominant rxn at lower temperatures.

	Literature review: n-C3H7 + O2 = HO2 + C3H6
	pg. 914-915: Discussion on evaluated data
	Entry 41,3 (a): The author suggests a rate coefficient based on those reported in the
		literature.  The author notes that the data reported in the literature suggests
		the formation of C3H6 is controlled by the addition rxn.  The author further
		notes that it is surprising that p-dependence effects are not observed for
		C3H6 formation.

	Literature review: O2 + iC4H9 --> iC4H8 + HO2
	pg. 52-53: Discussion on evaluated data
	Entry 45,3 (a): The author recommends a rate coefficient based on the experiments performed
		by Baker et al. (yielding a disproportionation-to-decomposition ratio) and the
		current (Tsang) study's recommended iC4H9 unimolecular decomposition rate.
