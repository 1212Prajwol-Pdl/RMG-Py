	 CH2=CHC(=CH2)C(=CH2)CH-CH2 --> cyclobutene, 1,2-diethenyl. (Apparently, reaction of 4->5; doesn't seem to be a birad recombination; note similar reaction in reference 6
	 Data derived from fitting to a complex mechanism. Excitation: thermal, analysis: GC. Pressure 0.01-0.77 atm.
         ***Should probably be removed, as this does not fit with this reaction family*** GRM: I have commented it out for the time-being; the reaction that might actually be relevant here is 2->13 (Abb. 1)
         Verified by Greg Magoon (with translation help from CFG); Barrier, DA, and DE0 changed based on Gl. 8 on p. 1937; I didn't check if this was high-pressure limit

	 CH2=CHCH(.)CH2CH2CH(.)CH=CH2 --> 4-vinylcyclohexene. (Rxn. -c); arises from birad recombination of resonance isomer: .CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH(.)CH=CH2
	 Data are estimated.
         ***group for Y_rad_out looks to be incorrect*** ...instead of C_rad_out_H/OneDe, I think it should be C_rad_out_H2/OneDe for considering the appropriate resonance form; nevermind...I think the C_rad_out_OneDe would be used for the "incorrect" resonance form, and C_rad_out_H/OneDe would be used here; UPDATE 2: I don't think C_rad_out_OneDe would be used for either case, as this is in the no hydrogen part of the tree; C_rad_out_2H is probably what should be used (otherwise, this rate will be applied to the incorrect reaction), but there is no allowance for delocalizing correction
         ***this only considers cis-cis isomer reaction*** cis-trans A prefactor is 50% of the value used here; also, on p. 4923, it is stated that cis trans rate is 5/6 of the overall rate, so maybe the k that should be used is 0.6 of the value currently in place?
        Verified by Greg Magoon: Rxn. -d. also looks to be of interest here; whether the rate is high-pressure limit was not investigated
