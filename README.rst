RMG Py - Reaction Mechanism Generator (Python Version)
******************************************************

This repository contains the Python version of Reaction Mechanism Generator 
(RMG), a tool for automatically generating kinetic models of chemical reaction
mechanisms, and related projects. RMG is developed primarily by researchers in 
`Prof. Green's research group <http://web.mit.edu/greengp/>`_ at the 
`Massachusetts Institute of Technology <http://web.mit.edu/>`_. 
Details can be found at `Sourceforge <http://rmg.sourceforge.net/>`_ or by 
emailing `rmg_dev@mit.edu <mailto:rmg_dev@mit.edu>`_.

The current projects in this repository are:

* **CanTherm** - A tool for extracting useful information from quantum 
  chemistry calculations

* **ChemPy** - A base library of common chemistry classes and functions

* **RMG Database** - A database of chemical knowledge used by RMG to determine
  thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for its models

* **MEASURE** - Master Equation Automatic Solver for Unimolecular REactions

* **RMG** - The main Reaction Mechanism Generator code

* **StatesFit** - A small library for fitting of vibrational modes to heat 
  capacity data
