# Required python packages for CanTherm. You can install them all via something like:
#    pip install -r requirements_cantherm.txt

# Numpy must be fully installed before many of the other packages will install,
# So you may well have to do this one manually first, before using this requirements file.

numpy
scipy
cython>=0.19
quantities
argparse

# PyCairo must be installed manually as it has problems with pip
