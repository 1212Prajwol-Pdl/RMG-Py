Introduction to ChemPy
**********************

ChemPy is a free, open-source `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ toolkit for 
chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science applications. 

Dependencies
============

ChemPy builds on a number of Python packages (in addition to those in the Python
standard library):

* `Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_. Provides a means to compile annotated 
  Python modules to C, combining the rapid development of Python with near-C
  execution speeds.

* `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_. Provides efficient matrix algebra.

* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_. Extends NumPy with a variety of mathematics 
  tools useful in scientific computing.

* `OpenBabel <http://openbabel.org/>`_. Provides functionality for converting
  between a variety of chemical formats.
